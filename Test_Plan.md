# Test Plan for Master-Slave Replication System

## 1. Introduction / Overview

### Purpose of the test plan
This test plan outlines the testing strategy for the Master-Slave Replication System with Fault Tolerance. The goal is to ensure the system's reliability, consistency, and fault tolerance capabilities.

### Project background
The system implements a Master-Slave replication pattern with fault tolerance features inspired by the Raft consensus algorithm. It consists of a master node and three slave nodes that maintain synchronized key-value stores.

### Intended audience
- Development team
- Quality Assurance team
- System administrators
- Technical stakeholders

## 2. Test Objectives

### Functional Goals
- Validate correct implementation of master-slave replication
- Verify data consistency across all nodes
- Ensure proper handling of write operations
- Verify read operations from slave nodes
- Test delete operations
- Validate log-based recovery mechanism

### Non-functional Goals
- Verify system performance under load
- Test fault tolerance capabilities
- Validate system recovery after failures
- Ensure thread safety
- Verify cross-platform compatibility

## 3. Scope

### In-scope
- Node operations (master and slave)
- Replication mechanism
- Fault tolerance features
- Log-based recovery
- Data consistency
- System API functionality
- Thread safety
- Cross-platform compatibility

### Out-of-scope
- Network infrastructure testing
